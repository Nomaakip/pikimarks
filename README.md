# Questions
### Where are my bookmarks?
![chrome_D0LeAAUfRk](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4052b66e-9f3b-4d3b-9314-8d20dc24bf2c)
### Do you have access to my bookmarks?
No. They're [in your local storage](https://github.com/ozgq/pikimarks/blob/b570bff2cffef53a472c12406429800cd13b4a78/pikimarks.user.js#L24). 
### Why are they not in a tab?
Because the way tabs are handled are weird, and I don't have the time to make a completely different tab.

**Short answer: No public-facing API.**
