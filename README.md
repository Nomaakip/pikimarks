# Do you have access to my bookmarks?
No. They're in your local storage. 
# Why are they not in a tab?
Because the way tabs are handled are weird, and I don't have the time to make a completely different tab that gets all of your bookmarks and shows them beautifully.
Short answer: No public-facing API.
